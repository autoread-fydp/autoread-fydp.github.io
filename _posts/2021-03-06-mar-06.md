I tried to retrain again with the Karen Savage data after changing each line to be separated by each sentence. The goal here is to allow more empty space between words so that aeneas might work better. Unfortunately, still nothing. The tensorboard training history can be found [here](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/pLpjm3qDRomX9LYoZFeMiQ/)
