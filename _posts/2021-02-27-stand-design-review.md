The ongoing pandemic situation has led to a reconsideration of the previous camera stand design from fall 2020. At this point we are almost certainly abandoning the old wood/metal construction and opting for a fully 3-D printed chassis. 

At this point WatiMake is available for print orders but may have a long lead time. I began modeling a new stand for 3-D printing, but dimensions and tolerance limitations are still uncertain at this time.
