I decided to try yet another dataset, this time the [Blizzard dataset](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/blizzard/2012/phase_two/). The tensorboard results can be seen [here](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/yCeysWPnQ82ZcJoMvX2RsQ/). With this dataset, it is again successful at making sound! Unfortunately, the sound is very garbled and slow. The fact that it is making sound is interesting though. The fact that this is a human-labeled dataset probably helps, but I'm not too sure why my hand labeled data isn't working then.
